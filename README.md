# Hangman-Game
The Hangman game is a word-guessing game typically played between two or more people. One player thinks of a word and marks the number of letters with dashes, representing the hidden word. The other players attempt to guess the word by suggesting letters or guessing the entire word.

Here's how the game is usually played:

1. One player, known as the "host" or "thinker," selects a word in secret.
2. The host determines the category or theme for the word if desired (e.g., animals, countries, movies).
3. The host then draws a series of dashes on a piece of paper or a whiteboard, each dash representing a letter in the word. For example, if the word is "apple," the host would write "_ _ _ _ _" on the board.
4. Another player, known as the "guesser," starts by suggesting a letter that might be in the word.
5. If the letter is in the word, the host reveals all occurrences of that letter in the correct positions. For example, if the guesser suggests "p" for the word "apple," the host would fill in the second and fourth dashes: "_ p p _ _".
6. If the guessed letter is not in the word, the host starts drawing part of a "hangman" figure. With each incorrect guess, another part of the hangman is drawn (such as the head, body, arms, legs, etc.).
7. The guesser continues suggesting letters one at a time until they can either guess the entire word or until the hangman figure is completed.
8. The game ends when the guesser successfully guesses the word, completing the word on the board, or when the hangman figure is fully drawn, resulting in the guesser's loss.

The Hangman game tests the guesser's ability to deduce the hidden word by suggesting letters based on patterns and common words, while the host must keep track of the guessed letters and reveal them correctly. It can be played for fun or as a way to improve vocabulary and word-guessing skills.

In addition to the traditional pen-and-paper version, you can also find digital versions of the Hangman game available online or as smartphone apps. These versions often include visual representations of the hangman figure and may provide hints or additional features to enhance gameplay.
